# Angular Universal: Server-side Rendering in Angular Frameworks

Angular Universal is a feature in the Angular framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) of Angular applications. With Angular Universal, Angular applications can be run on the server-side, allowing them to be integrated with server-side tools and frameworks like Asp.Net WebForms and Asp.Net MVC. This helps to enhance the performance and provide a better user experience, as the initial render of the page can be done on the server, reducing the time required to display the content on the client.
